      "The memory currently contains an attempt to solve the query using the Python_Code_Generator_Tool, which resulted in an incorrect expression that evaluates to 6.75 instead of 24. This indicates that the memory is incomplete and insufficient for the following reasons:\n",

      "1. **Completeness**: The memory does not fully address the query as the expression generated does not equal 24. The task requires finding a valid arithmetic expression using the numbers [1, 1, 6, 9] that results in 24, which has not been achieved.\n",
